# Video-Game-Length-and-User-Score
With the increasing prevalence of the live-service model in gaming, it's clear that publishers are attempting to deliver more value to the consumer through extending the amount of hours of play that each title offers. But does increasing a game's playtime truly improve the perceived value of the game in the eyes of the consumer? In this analysis, we will explore the relationship between the average length of a video game and its average user rating. Data is from www.gamefaqs.com Game Rankings. The complete dataset is available above.

# The Dataset
This data come from www.gamefaqs.com 's Game Rankings. Users with a GameFAQs account can report the number of hours it took for them to complete a game and also rate it on a scale of 0-5, 5 being the best. The website reports the mean hours to complete and mean user score for each game. In this analysis, we will only look at games that have at least 100 user ratings in order to ensure the robustness of the data. Since we are interested in recent games, we will only include games from the PlayStation 4 console. The data is sorted from highest user rating to lowest user rating.
